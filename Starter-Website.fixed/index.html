<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>I grew up in a small town in Illinois called Warrenville approximately two hours outside of the city of Chicago. I recently moved to Arizona because I loved how different the state felt, the mountain hiking is extremely fun and enjoyable.</p>
		
	 <p>I originally had  plans of going to college for an enginnering degree, at the time I wasn't sure of which enginnering degree I wanted to pursue. After enough thinking I decieded to go into software enginnering and so far love it.</p> 
	 
	<p> I believe software enginnering to me is a perfect fit since I already love computers I have bulit both of my personal computer for gaming and work. I also enjoy working on team projects sharing opinions and and coming up with solutions creativly for problems that occur. 	</p>
